# Good_GoodBot_BadBot
A bot for bots for bots! Made by [/u/winnie33](https://www.reddit.com/user/winnie33/)

Put quite simply, whenever someone comments "good bot" on /u/B0tRank, this bot will reply how many people already said "good bot" to him.
There's also /u/Good_Good_GB_BB which took the chain even further, but he too stopped working when /u/GoodBot_BadBot stopped working. 
If you're a future internet historian, I'm sure this information is invaluable to you.

If there's any kind of feedback you would like to give on this bot, feel free to send me ([/u/winnie33](https://www.reddit.com/user/winnie33/), not the bot) a message!
If you are a moderator and don't want this bot anymore on your sub, banning him will be the fastest and easiest option. I don't mind at all :)

## FAQ

* Sometimes I see the bot respond multiple times with the same number, what's up with that?

A: Every time this bot responds, he fetches the data from [B0tRank's website](https://botrank.pastimes.eu), 
which might not always be up to date. Don't worry, the bot will never be off by more than a few numbers.

* How come the bot doesn't work at the end of each month?

A: This is going to sound very silly, but I'm hosting this bot on Heroku on the free plan. This means I don't have enough hours to
host it throughout the entire month. If you'd like to support this bot financially or by offering hosting services, I would be 
very grateful! Send me ([/u/winnie33](https://www.reddit.com/user/winnie33/), not the bot) a message! :)
